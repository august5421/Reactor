# Reactor
Reactor is a comprehensive, feature-rich ReactJSX boilerplate designed to streamline the development process for full-stack web applications. Built with Redux for state management and modern UI principles using Material-UI (MUI), this boilerplate empowers developers to rapidly build scalable and maintainable applications with a complete authentication flow, a robust CMS backend, and automated database setup.

Key Features:

Automated Database Setup: On initialization, the application detects a missing database and enters setup mode. The developer is prompted to select one of the supported database providers—Firebase, Supabase, or MongoDB—and input their configuration details. The backend automatically connects to the chosen database, populates the necessary schemas and default data, and updates the environment variables (.env file), ensuring seamless database integration without manual setup.

Authentication Flow: Out of the box, the boilerplate includes a fully integrated authentication system. This system supports secure user registration, login, and session management, with flexible options for OAuth authentication providers (e.g., Google, GitHub) alongside traditional email/password methods.

Comprehensive CMS Backend: The boilerplate comes with a flexible content management system (CMS) that provides an easy-to-use admin panel. This panel allows developers to manage dynamic content such as blog posts, user profiles, and custom application data, all through a simple and intuitive interface.

Customizable Frontend with MUI & Redux: The frontend is built using React, Redux, and Material-UI (MUI), giving developers a highly responsive and customizable user interface. The included components are pre-styled, and the application structure is designed for easy customization, ensuring a consistent, professional look with minimal effort.

Environment-Specific Configuration: With a robust configuration system, the app intelligently adapts to different environments—whether in development, production, or setup mode—ensuring a smooth transition between stages.

Seamless Developer Experience: The boilerplate is designed to drastically reduce the time spent setting up and configuring the fundamental aspects of web development, allowing developers to focus on building features and functionalities specific to their application. The integration of automated systems for database configuration, authentication, and content management ensures a streamlined process.

Technology Stack:

Frontend: React, Redux, Material-UI (MUI)
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: Firebase, Supabase, MongoDB (configurable during initialization)
Authentication: Firebase Authentication, OAuth (Google, GitHub), Email/Password
CMS: Custom Admin Panel

Ideal Use Cases:
Full-stack web applications that require rapid setup with a functional authentication system and a CMS backend.
Projects that need flexibility in choosing between different database providers without additional setup complexity.
Developers looking for a boilerplate that integrates modern tools and best practices, allowing them to focus on building core features.
By automating complex and repetitive setup tasks, Reactor reduces the development overhead for developers, enabling them to launch applications faster and with greater ease. It is the perfect starting point for developers looking to kickstart their next full-stack web application without reinventing the wheel.
